# Book-Store

Book-Store is a sample Web API project designed for managing books and borrowing operations.

## System Requirements

- SQL Server database
- Visual Studio (or any compatible IDE for .NET development)


## Assumptions

- Each book can only be borrowed by one user at a time to prevent duplication.
- Registration is open to anyone by providing their details.
- Deletion of records is handled using soft delete methodology.


## Future Enhancements

- **Reporting**: Add a report generation feature to summarize book borrowing statistics and user activities.
- **User Registration**: Implement email verification for new user registrations to enhance account security.
- **Password Management**: Introduce "Forgot Password" functionality with email-based password reset for user convenience.
